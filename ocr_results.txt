Image 237: Q: What caused our Big Bang? A: The repeated doubling in size of an explosive Lippe’ Speck of inflatin hi ne  muaterial. Q: Did our Big Bang happen at a single point?  A: Almost: it began in a region of space much smaller than an atom, Q: Where in space did our Big Bang explosion happen? A: In that tiny region—but inflation stretched it out to about the size of a  grapefruit growing so fast that the subsequent expansion made it larger than  all the space that we see today. Q: How could our Big Bang create an infinite space in a finite time?  A: Inflation produces an infinite number of galaxies by continuing forever According to general relativity, an observer in one of these galaxies will view space and time differently, perceiving space as having been infinite already  when inflation ended.

The segments at each end cannot be WSpecial. The stack sizes must be modified in such a way as to maximize the number of special segments, Te do so, choose any segment and increase the stack size by x. More formally,  TeChoose an index jand an integer x, where 0< x < 1078.  B increase the stack size of i*” segment from threadsizefi] to threadSizefi] + x.  Find the minimum total increase in the stack size of the segments  Example  IGiven n= 6, and threadSize =[3, 1, 4, 5,5, 2]  ibis optimal to add 2 and 1 to the third and fifth segments, respectively. The final stack sizes of the Segments are [3, 1, 6, 5, 6, 2]  So the answer = 2 + 1 = 3.  It can be seen that with this change, the required configuration is achieved with a maximum possible of special segments. This is the minimum possible total increase in the stack sizes.
